# ACCA-RPG
The "open source" tabletop roleplaying game.

**This README is a dumpster fire. I typed it out really quick. It will be redone eventually. Sorry about that.**

**THIS PROJECT IS IN VERY EARLY ALPHA STAGES. WE DON'T EVEN KNOW WHAT THE CORE CONCEPTS OF THE GAME ARE YET**


## Wtf is this?
ACCA (working name) is a project that aims to be a fully community driven tabletop roleplaying game. This is (as far as i'm aware) the only open source ttrpg. This means that anyone who has an idea or improvement for the game and wants to implement it can do so (as long as the rest of the community is okay with it). This is exactly like any programming open source project. (although you don't have to be into that kind of thing be enjoy this project)

## Nice, but how does it actually work?
I'm going to use an example. Lets say that you have an idea for how to improve combat in the game. You would follow the steps below:
1) Take your idea and figure out how you're going to implement it
2) Clone the repository for the game (Where all the game rules are hosted. Where you are right now!) and implement your ideas into the version of the game that you have
3) Open a pull request explaining what your changes are and why they should be in the main game
4) Now the community comes in. Everyone who is wanting will cast a vote on whether or not they think your idea should be in the main game. If they vote yes, congradulations your idea will be in the next major edition of the game as well as its current "in between" version. (more on this later) If the community doesn't like your idea then you can either forget about it, or play your version of the game on your own. (you could even create a "fork" which in this context is another game based on this game)

## What actually *is* the game?
ACCA aims to be a setting neutral and easy to change (easy to add/remove rules) ttrpg. **As the game actually reaches a point beyond the readme this section will be expanded**

## What's in the name?
Okay. I'm sorry for this. ACCA stands for *A*nyone *C*an *C*ontribute (to) *A*CCA. An acronym inside an acronym!?! Whaaaaat! Jokes aside we may need a better name in the future but for now it's fun.

## How do (will) releases work?
My current idea for this is to have a release once every 6 months or year. At these times all rules that have been added by the community in between releases will be added. These will be the "big number releases" meaning 1.0, 2.0, 3.0, etc. In between we will have the "small number releases" which are things like 1.1, 1.2, 1.3, 1.15, etc which are every added rule as they're added. We are not going to do a "rolling release" in which every new rule that is added is in the main game automaticly--no one wants to change their game mechanics that much! 

## How much will this cost?
The game itself will always be free. Acessing the core rules will never cost you a dime.

## How can I add to the game
Have a concept you want to add? Send a pull request! We will have the repo setup in such a way that each individual rule or concept has it's own markdown file (something like a file for each weapon or skill) as well as a full rulebook that is fully updated for each "big number release".

**Once again sorry for the poor quality of the readme**
